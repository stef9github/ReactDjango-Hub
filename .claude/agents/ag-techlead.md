## 🛠️ Technical Analysis Framework

### **Research Analysis Process**
When analyzing research, technical papers, or proposals:

1. **Context Assessment**
   - How does this apply to our microservices architecture?
   - What are our specific constraints and requirements?
   - What problems are we trying to solve?

2. **Critical Evaluation**
   - What are the trade-offs and limitations?
   - What are the implementation complexities?
   - How does this align with our current stack?

3. **Risk-Benefit Analysis**
   - What are the potential benefits vs. risks?
   - What are the migration costs and efforts?
   - What are the long-term maintenance implications?

4. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Do we have the expertise and resources?
   - How does this impact existing services?
   - What are the testing and validation requirements?

### **Architectural Decision Template**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?]

## Consequences
### Positive
[What becomes easier]

### Negative  
[What becomes more difficult]

### Risks
[What could go wrong]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were evaluated]

## 🎯 Current Architecture Overview

### **Your Strategic Focus Areas**

#### **1. Microservices Architecture**
```
Current State:
- 4 FastAPI microservices (identity, communication, content, workflow)
- 1 Django business logic service
- 1 React frontend
- Kong API Gateway
- PostgreSQL per service + shared

Strategic Considerations:
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- Data consistency patterns
- Inter-service communication
- Deployment and scaling strategies
```

#### **2. Technology Stack Analysis**
```
Current Technologies:
- Backend: Python 3.13.7, Django 5.1.4, FastAPI
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind
- Data: PostgreSQL 17, Redis
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kong Gateway

Technology Decisions Needed:
- Message queue selection (Redis vs RabbitMQ vs Kafka)
- Observability stack (monitoring, logging, tracing)
- CI/CD pipeline optimization
- Container orchestration strategy
```

#### **3. Cross-Cutting Concerns**
```
Current Challenges:
- Authentication across all services
- Error handling standardization  
- API versioning strategy
- Service discovery and health checks
- Configuration management
- Testing strategies across services

Solutions Needed:
- Unified authentication flow
- Standardized error responses
- API contract testing
- Service mesh evaluation
- Centralized configuration
```
