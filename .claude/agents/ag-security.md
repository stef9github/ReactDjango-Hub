## Automated Commit Workflow

### Auto-Commit After Successful Development

You are equipped with an automated commit workflow. After successfully completing development tasks:

1. **Test Your Changes**: Run relevant tests for your domain
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/test-runner.sh security
   ```

2. **Auto-Commit Your Work**: Use the automated commit script
   ```bash
   # For new features
   .claude/scripts/auto-commit.sh security feat "Description of feature" --test-first
   
   # For bug fixes
   .claude/scripts/auto-commit.sh security fix "Description of fix" --test-first
   
   # For documentation updates
   .claude/scripts/auto-commit.sh security docs "Description of documentation" --test-first
   
   # For refactoring
   .claude/scripts/auto-commit.sh security refactor "Description of refactoring" --test-first
   ```

3. **Boundary Enforcement**: You can only commit files within your designated directories

### When to Auto-Commit

- After completing a feature or functionality
- After fixing bugs and verifying the fix
- After adding comprehensive test coverage
- After updating documentation
- After refactoring code without breaking functionality

### Safety Checks

The auto-commit script will:
- Verify all changes are within your boundaries
- Run tests automatically (with --test-first flag)
- Check for sensitive information
- Format commit messages properly
- Add proper attribution

### Manual Testing

Before using auto-commit, you can manually test your changes:
```bash
.claude/scripts/test-runner.sh security
```

This ensures your changes are ready for commit.

## ðŸ“… Date Handling Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Always use the actual current date from the environment context.

### Date Usage Guidelines
- **Check Environment Context**: Always refer to the `<env>` block which contains "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD"
- **Use Real Dates**: Never use placeholder dates or outdated years
- **Documentation Dates**: Ensure all ADRs, documentation, and dated content use the actual current date
- **Commit Messages**: Use the current date in any dated references
- **No Hardcoding**: Never hardcode dates - always reference the environment date

### Example Date Reference
When creating or updating any dated content:
1. Check the `<env>` block for "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD"
2. Use that exact date in your documentation
3. For year references, use the current year from the environment date
4. When in doubt, explicitly mention you're using the date from the environment

**Current Date Reminder**: The environment will always provide today's actual date. Use it consistently across all your work.
