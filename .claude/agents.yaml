# Agent interaction rules
rules:
  separation_of_concerns:
    - Each agent manages only its designated service/domain
    - Cross-service changes require coordination through Services Coordinator
    - Infrastructure changes go through Infrastructure Agent
    
  communication_patterns:
    - Services communicate only through defined APIs
    - No direct database access between services
    - Use message queues for async communication
    
  quality_standards:
    - All code changes require review
    - Maintain >80% test coverage
    - Security scanning on all deployments
    - Documentation for all public APIs
