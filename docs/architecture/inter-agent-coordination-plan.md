# Inter-Agent Coordination Plan

## Executive Summary

This document defines the coordination protocols, communication patterns, and dependency management strategies for all agents working on the ReactDjango Hub platform. It ensures smooth handoffs, clear boundaries, and efficient collaboration across the microservices architecture.

## Coordination Principles

### 1. Service Boundary Respect
- Each agent operates within their defined service boundaries
- Cross-service changes require explicit coordination
- No agent directly modifies another service's code

### 2. API Contract First
- Service interfaces are defined before implementation
- Changes to APIs require coordination with consumers
- Breaking changes require versioning strategy

### 3. Documentation as Communication
- All handoffs include written documentation
- API changes are documented in OpenAPI specs
- Integration points are clearly specified

### 4. Test-Driven Integration
- Integration points have automated tests
- Changes are validated before handoff
- Both parties verify integration success

## Agent Communication Matrix

### Direct Communication Requirements

| Agent A | Agent B | Communication Type | Frequency | Protocol |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| ag-frontend | ag-coordinator | API endpoint mapping | Per feature | Documentation + Testing |
| ag-frontend | ag-identity | Auth UI requirements | Per auth feature | API spec + UI mockups |
| ag-frontend | ag-communication | WebSocket events | Per real-time feature | Event schema docs |
| ag-coordinator | All service agents | Route configuration | Per endpoint | Kong config + OpenAPI |
| ag-infrastructure | All agents | Deployment changes | Per deployment | Change notification |
| ag-techlead | All agents | Architecture decisions | As needed | ADRs + Guidelines |

### Coordination Workflows

## Workflow 1: New API Endpoint Integration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SA as Service Agent
    participant CO as Coordinator
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant INF as Infrastructure
    
    SA->>SA: Implement endpoint
    SA->>SA: Write OpenAPI spec
    SA->>CO: Request route configuration
    Note over SA,CO: Provides endpoint details
    CO->>CO: Configure Kong route
    CO->>CO: Add plugins (JWT, rate limit)
    CO->>FE: Provide route mapping
    Note over CO,FE: Documents endpoint URL
    FE->>FE: Update API client
    FE->>FE: Implement UI
    FE->>CO: Test via Kong
    CO->>SA: Verify integration
    SA->>INF: Ready for deployment
    INF->>INF: Deploy to staging
```

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Service Agent** (e.g., ag-identity):
   - Implements new endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/profile`)
   - Creates/updates OpenAPI specification
   - Tests endpoint locally
   - Commits with message: `feat(identity): add user profile endpoint`

2. **Coordinator Agent**:
   - Reviews OpenAPI spec
   - Configures Kong route:
     ```yaml
     - name: user-profile
       paths: ['/api/v1/users/profile']
       service: identity-service
       plugins:
         - name: jwt
         - name: cors
         - name: rate-limiting
     ```
   - Documents in `infrastructure/kong/routes.md`
   - Commits: `feat(kong): add route for user profile endpoint`

3. **Frontend Agent**:
   - Updates API client:
     ```typescript
     getUserProfile: () => apiClient.get('/api/v1/users/profile')
     ```
   - Implements UI components
   - Tests through Kong gateway
   - Commits: `feat(frontend): integrate user profile API`

4. **Infrastructure Agent**:
   - Deploys all changes to staging
   - Runs integration tests
   - Promotes to production

## Workflow 2: Authentication Flow Implementation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant CO as Coordinator
    participant ID as Identity Service
    participant INF as Infrastructure
    
    ID->>ID: Implement auth endpoints
    ID->>CO: Provide auth API spec
    CO->>CO: Configure JWT plugin
    CO->>FE: Share auth flow docs
    FE->>FE: Build login UI
    FE->>FE: Implement token storage
    FE->>ID: Test auth flow via Kong
    ID->>FE: Verify token handling
    CO->>CO: Monitor auth metrics
    INF->>INF: Deploy complete flow
```

### Handoff Points:

1. **Identity → Coordinator**:
   - Provides: JWT structure, token lifetimes, refresh strategy
   - Documentation: `services/identity-service/docs/auth-flow.md`

2. **Coordinator → Frontend**:
   - Provides: Kong endpoints, JWT validation rules
   - Documentation: `infrastructure/kong/auth-configuration.md`

3. **Frontend → Identity**:
   - Tests: Login, logout, refresh, MFA flows
   - Feedback: UI requirements, error handling needs

## Workflow 3: WebSocket Integration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant CO as Coordinator
    participant CM as Communication
    participant INF as Infrastructure
    
    CM->>CM: Implement WS server
    CM->>CO: Provide WS spec
    CO->>CO: Configure WS proxy
    CO->>FE: Share WS endpoints
    FE->>FE: Implement WS client
    FE->>CM: Connect via Kong
    CM->>FE: Send real-time events
    FE->>FE: Update UI real-time
    INF->>INF: Scale WS connections
```

### Coordination Requirements:

1. **Communication Service**:
   - Defines event schemas
   - Implements connection handling
   - Provides reconnection strategy

2. **Coordinator**:
   - Configures WebSocket upgrade in Kong
   - Sets up connection pooling
   - Monitors WebSocket metrics

3. **Frontend**:
   - Implements WebSocket manager
   - Handles reconnection logic
   - Updates UI with real-time data

## Dependency Management

### Critical Path Dependencies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Infrastructure: Service Deployment] --> B[Coordinator: Kong Configuration]
    B --> C[Services: API Implementation]
    C --> D[Frontend: UI Integration]
    B --> E[Identity: Auth Setup]
    E --> D
    B --> F[Communication: WebSocket]
    F --> D
```

### Dependency Resolution Process

   - Update relevant documentation

2. **Level 2: Coordinator Mediation**
   - ag-coordinator helps resolve integration conflicts
   - Focuses on API contracts and boundaries
   - Documents resolution

3. **Level 3: Technical Lead Decision**
   - ag-techlead makes final decision
   - Creates ADR if needed
   - Updates architecture documentation

### Common Conflict Scenarios

| Conflict Type | Resolution Approach | Decision Maker |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| API design disagreement | Follow REST/GraphQL standards | ag-coordinator |
| Service boundary dispute | Check microservices principles | ag-techlead |
| Technology choice | Evaluate trade-offs | ag-techlead |
| Performance vs. features | Measure and prioritize | Product + ag-techlead |
| Timeline conflicts | Reassess dependencies | Project management |

## Communication Channels

## Timeline Considerations

### Sprint 1 Coordination Points

| Week 2 | WebSocket server → Frontend client | Communication → Coordinator → Frontend |
| Week 2 | Service APIs → Frontend integration | All services → Frontend |

### Dependency Mitigation Strategies

1. **Parallel Development**:
   - Mock APIs for frontend development
   - Stub services for testing
   - Contract-first development

2. **Early Integration**:
   - Test integration points early
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Identify critical path early
   - Have backup plans for blockers
   - Prioritize based on dependencies
