# Agent Architecture Expansion - Implementation Summary

## Quick Reference

This document provides a quick reference for the agent architecture expansion proposed in [ADR-007](/docs/architecture/adr/007-agent-architecture-expansion.md).

## Recommended New Agents by Priority

### Priority 1: Critical Platform Gaps (Implement Immediately)

#### ag-data - Data Operations Agent
**Why Now**: Data governance is fragmented across services with no unified approach.
- **Focus**: Database schemas, migrations, data consistency
- **First Tasks**: 
  - Standardize migration patterns across all 5 PostgreSQL instances
  - Implement cross-service data synchronization for shared entities
  - Create data privacy compliance framework

#### ag-testing - Testing Strategy Agent  
**Why Now**: Identity service has 100% coverage, other services are at <40%.
- **Focus**: Unified testing framework, coverage improvement
- **First Tasks**:
  - Port identity service testing patterns to other services
  - Set up integration test orchestration
  - Create shared test fixtures and data factories

#### ag-api - API Documentation & Contracts Agent
**Why Now**: Kong Gateway integration requires proper API contracts.
- **Focus**: OpenAPI specs, versioning, contract testing
- **First Tasks**:
  - Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specs for all 4 microservices
  - Configure Kong API Gateway routes from specs
  - Implement contract testing between services

### Priority 2: Vertical Market Specialization (Next Quarter)

#### ag-medical - Medical Domain Agent
**When to Create**: When implementing medical appointment system
- **Focus**: HIPAA compliance, medical workflows, healthcare integrations
- **Trigger**: First medical client onboarding

#### ag-public - Public Sector Agent
**When to Create**: When implementing public procurement features
- **Focus**: Government compliance, procurement workflows, citizen services
- **Trigger**: Public sector vertical launch

### Priority 3: Platform Excellence (Future)

#### ag-performance - Performance Optimization Agent
**When to Create**: After establishing performance baselines
- **Focus**: Profiling, caching, optimization
- **Trigger**: First performance bottleneck in production

#### ag-devops - DevOps Automation Agent
**When to Create**: When manual deployment becomes bottleneck
- **Focus**: CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code
- **Trigger**: Need for continuous deployment

#### ag-analytics - Analytics & Monitoring Agent
**When to Create**: After initial production deployment
- **Focus**: Metrics, dashboards, observability
- **Trigger**: Need for business intelligence

## Implementation Guide

### How to Create a New Agent

1. **Create Agent Configuration**
```bash
# Create agent markdown file
touch .claude/agents/ag-{name}.md

# Add YAML frontmatter
---
name: ag-{name}
description: Clear description of agent purpose
tools: optional,comma,separated,list
---
```

2. **Update Agent Registry**
```yaml
# In .claude/agents.yaml
agents:
  - name: {name}
    description: Agent purpose
    file: ag-{name}.md
```

3. **Create Documentation Structure**
```bash
# Create agent documentation directory
mkdir -p docs/agents/{name}
touch docs/agents/{name}/README.md
touch docs/agents/{name}/responsibilities.md
touch docs/agents/{name}/integration-guide.md
```

4. **Update Launcher Script**
```bash
# Ensure agent is recognized in launcher
./.claude/launch-agent.sh {name}
```

## Integration Requirements

### For Priority 1 Agents (Data, Testing, API)

These agents need immediate access to:
- All service codebases (read access)
- Configuration files (read/write for their domain)
- Documentation directories (write access)
- CI/CD pipelines (modification rights)

### For Priority 2 Agents (Medical, Public)

These agents will need:
- Domain-specific documentation areas
- Access to vertical-specific code directories
- Ability to create domain models
- Integration with workflow service

### For Priority 3 Agents (Performance, DevOps, Analytics)

These agents will require:
- Infrastructure access (monitoring)
- Production metrics access
- Deployment pipeline control
- Analytics database access

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Deliverables
- [ ] ag-data agent created and operational
- [ ] ag-testing agent improving test coverage
- [ ] ag-api agent documenting all endpoints

### Month 1 Metrics
- [ ] Test coverage >80% across all services
- [ ] All APIs have OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Data migration strategy documented

### Quarter 1 Goals
- [ ] Vertical-specific agents operational
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Automated deployment achieved

## Risk Mitigation

### Agent Sprawl Prevention
- Maximum 12 agents total
- Regular agent consolidation reviews
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### Coordination Overhead
- Weekly agent sync documentation
- Clear integration patterns
- Automated agent interaction logging

## Quick Decision Tree

**Should I create a new agent?**

```
Is this a new domain requiring specialized expertise?
├── YES → Is it critical for current sprint?
│   ├── YES → Create Priority 1 agent NOW
│   └── NO → Schedule for Priority 2/3
└── NO → Can existing agent handle with minor expansion?
    ├── YES → Expand existing agent
    └── NO → Document need, revisit next sprint
```
