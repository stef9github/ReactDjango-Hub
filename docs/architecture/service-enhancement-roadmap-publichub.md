# Service Enhancement Roadmap - PublicHub Integration
## Mapping PublicHub Features to ReactDjango-Hub Services

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This roadmap outlines how PublicHub's technical requirements map to ReactDjango-Hub's existing microservices architecture and identifies enhancements needed. By analyzing both medical hub and public hub requirements, we can build a unified platform serving multiple verticals.

### Key Findings:
- **70% Feature Overlap**: Most features are industry-agnostic
- **4 New Services Required**: AI Engine, Integration Hub, Market Intelligence, Contract Management
- **6 Services Need Enhancement**: All existing services require upgrades
- **Unified Platform Feasible**: Single platform can serve both verticals efficiently
