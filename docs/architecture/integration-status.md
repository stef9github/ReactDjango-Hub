### API Endpoint Testing

```bash
# All endpoints tested and verified:

✅ GET  http://localhost:8000/health                    # Kong health
✅ GET  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/health        # Identity via Kong
✅ GET  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/documents/health   # Content via Kong
✅ GET  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/notifications/health # Communication via Kong
✅ GET  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows/health   # Workflow via Kong

# Direct service access (development):
✅ GET  http://localhost:8001/health  # Identity direct
✅ GET  http://localhost:8002/health  # Content direct
✅ GET  http://localhost:8003/health  # Communication direct
✅ GET  http://localhost:8004/health  # Workflow direct
```

## Frontend Integration Readiness

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Frontend .env.development
VITE_KONG_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_KONG_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:8445
VITE_API_VERSION=v1
VITE_ENABLE_DIRECT_SERVICE=false  # Use Kong gateway
```

### API Client Configuration

```typescript
// Ready to use configuration
const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  // Authentication
  login: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login',
  register: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register',
  refresh: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/refresh',
  
  // User Management
  users: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users',

  ai: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai',
};
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### 1. Service Initialization Timing
- **Issue**: Services may take 10-30 seconds to fully initialize
- **Workaround**: Implemented health checks and retry logic
- **Solution**: Use `health-check-all.sh` to verify readiness

### 2. Database Migration Order
- **Issue**: Services need databases ready before migrations
- **Workaround**: Proper dependency chain in docker-compose
- **Solution**: Automated in startup script

### 3. JWT Secret Synchronization
- **Issue**: All services need same JWT secret
- **Workaround**: Shared .env.shared file
- **Future**: Implement secret management service

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'

# 6. View logs if needed
docker-compose logs -f identity-service
```

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

### Immediate Actions (Frontend Team)

1. **Update API Configuration**
   - Use Kong gateway URL (http://localhost:8000)
   - Remove direct service URLs from production config
   - Implement retry logic for initialization period

2. **Implement Authentication Flow**
   - JWT token management through Kong
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Logout and blacklist handling

3. **Add Service Health Monitoring**
   - Dashboard showing service status
   - Alert on service failures
   - Automatic retry on transient failures

### Infrastructure Improvements (Next Sprint)

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Kubernetes manifests based on docker-compose
   - SSL/TLS configuration for Kong
   - Production database setup

2. **Monitoring Stack**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Zipkin distributed tracing

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Secrets management (Vault/K8s secrets)
   - Network policies
   - API rate limiting tuning
