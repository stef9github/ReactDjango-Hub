# PublicHub Realistic Fundraising Timeline
*From Solo Developer to Funded Startup (September 2025 - March 2027)*

## Executive Summary

This timeline reflects the reality of fundraising with a solo technical founder building the product while the business co-founder drives commercial development. The strategy focuses on achieving concrete milestones before each funding round, recognizing that investors need to see real traction, not just promises.

## Fundraising Philosophy

### Reality Checks
1. **No product = No funding** (except F&F round)
2. **Demo ≠ Traction** (need real customers)
3. **LOIs ≠ Revenue** (need paying users)
4. **French investors move slowly** (3-6 month processes)
5. **Solo developer = Higher risk** (need mitigation story)

### Our Approach
- **Milestone-driven**: Raise only when ready
- **Revenue-first**: Prove willingness to pay
- **Strategic investors**: Smart money over any money
- **Conservative projections**: Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Extended runway**: 18+ months per round

## Conclusion

This realistic timeline acknowledges that fundraising with a solo developer requires stronger proof points than a traditional team. By focusing on revenue first and raising capital only when truly ready, PublicHub can achieve better valuations and maintain more control.

The key is patience: better to raise at €50K MRR with strong metrics than €10K MRR with just promises. Each month of bootstrap operation increases valuation and reduces risk, making the eventual fundraise smoother and more favorable.

Success depends on:
1. **Hitting milestones** before starting fundraising
2. **Building relationships** before needing money
3. **Showing momentum** through consistent growth
4. **Proving efficiency** with capital management
5. **Demonstrating vision** beyond current product
