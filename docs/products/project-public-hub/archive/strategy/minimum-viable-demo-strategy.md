# PublicHub Minimum Viable Demo (MVD) Strategy
*Building Just Enough to Win Hearts, Minds, and Commitments*

## Executive Summary

The MVD strategy prioritizes demonstration capability over full functionality, recognizing that early-stage B2G sales depend on vision communication more than feature completeness. Each demo milestone is designed to secure specific commitments: LOIs at Salon des Maires, beta users in January, and investors by March 2026.

## Core Philosophy

### Demo ≠ Product
- **Demo Goal:** Show what's possible, create excitement
- **Product Goal:** Deliver actual value in production
- **Our Approach:** Build demo features that evolve into real features
- **Time Allocation:** 70% demo polish, 30% backend functionality

### Psychology of B2G Demos
1. **Risk Aversion:** Public servants fear making mistakes
2. **Peer Validation:** They want to see others using it
3. **Compliance Focus:** Must appear legally sound
4. **ROI Pressure:** Need clear time/cost savings
5. **French Pride:** Prefer local solutions

## Demo Development Tactics

### UI-First Development
```javascript
// Week 1: Build the UI shell
const Dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <StatsWidget title="Active Tenders" value="42" />
      <StatsWidget title="Documents" value="127" />
      <RecentDocuments documents={DEMO_DATA} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Week 4: Connect to real data
const Dashboard = () => {
  const { stats, documents } = useRealData();
  // Same UI, now with real data
};
```

### Progressive Enhancement Pattern
1. **Step 1:** Static HTML/CSS
2. **Step 2:** Add React interactivity
3. **Step 3:** Connect to API
4. **Step 4:** Add error handling
5. **Step 5:** Optimize performance

### Demo Data Strategy
```python
# demos/fixtures.py
DEMO_ORGANIZATIONS = [
    {"name": "Mairie de Bordeaux", "size": "Grande ville"},
    {"name": "Département de la Gironde", "type": "Département"},
    {"name": "Région Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "type": "Région"},
]

DEMO_TENDERS = [
    {
        "title": "Rénovation éclairage public",
        "amount": "250 000 €",
        "deadline": "15 jours",
        "status": "En cours"
    },
    # ... 20 more realistic examples
]
```

### Fallback Mechanisms
```python
def get_boamp_tenders():
    try:
        # Try real API
        return fetch_from_boamp()
    except:
        # Return cached demo data
        return CACHED_DEMO_TENDERS
```

## Risk Mitigation

## Conclusion

The MVD strategy recognizes that in B2G markets, the demo sells the vision while the product delivers the value. By focusing on demo excellence at each milestone, PublicHub can secure the commitments needed to progress from idea to funded company.

Each demo phase builds on the previous, gradually transitioning from "smoke and mirrors" to real functionality. This approach minimizes development time while maximizing market validation and fundraising potential.

The key is maintaining the discipline to build only what's needed for each demo milestone, resisting feature creep, and using customer feedback to guide real product development.
