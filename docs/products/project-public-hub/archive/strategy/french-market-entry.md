# PublicHub French Market Entry Strategy
*A French-First Approach to Dominating the €100B Public Procurement Market*

## Executive Summary

PublicHub will launch as a **French-first** platform, leveraging Nicolas Mangin's 16+ years of established relationships through GENILUM and deep procurement expertise to establish immediate market credibility. With direct access to hundreds of communes who already trust Nicolas, combined with Stéphane's technical innovation, we will build an insurmountable competitive advantage before considering international expansion.

## Strategic Rationale for French-First Approach

### Market Advantages
1. **Language Authenticity**: Native French interface builds immediate trust with public servants

5. **Network Effects**: Faster adoption through word-of-mouth in tight-knit public sector
