### Financial Risks
- **Risk:** Longer sales cycles than expected
- **Mitigation:** Parallel tracks, multiple revenue streams, conservative burn

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Speed of Execution** - First-mover advantage in AI-powered procurement
2. **Customer Obsession** - Deep understanding of public sector needs
3. **Product Excellence** - 10x better than existing solutions
4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Leverage associations and channels

## Conclusion

The two-founder structure enables PublicHub to compress the typical 18-24 month journey to product-market fit into 12-15 months. By executing technical development and market development in parallel, we can launch faster, iterate more quickly, and scale more efficiently than competitors.

The roadmap balances aggressive growth targets with sustainable execution, positioning PublicHub to become the category-defining solution for French public procurement by end of 2026.
