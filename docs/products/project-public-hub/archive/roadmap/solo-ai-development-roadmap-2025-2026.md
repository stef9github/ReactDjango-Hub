# PublicHub Solo AI-Assisted Development Roadmap 2025-2026
*Realistic Timeline for Single Developer with Claude Code Support*

## Executive Summary

This roadmap reflects the reality of solo development starting end of September 2025, with Nicolas Mangin handling business development while the technical co-founder builds the platform with AI assistance. The timeline prioritizes demo-quality features for Salon des Maires (November 19-21, 2025) and working MVP for early 2026, with fundraising targeted for May-June 2026.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Ship Early, Ship Often** - Deploy weekly, get feedback constantly
2. **Demo First** - Build for demonstrations before full functionality
3. **Buy vs Build** - Use existing services and libraries whenever possible
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
5. **AI Acceleration** - Leverage Claude Code for 2-3x productivity gains

### Reality Constraints
- **One Developer** - Cannot parallelize development tasks
- **No DevOps Team** - Must use managed services (Heroku/Railway)
- **Limited Testing** - Focus on critical path testing only
- **No Custom Infrastructure** - Use off-the-shelf solutions
- **Customer Feedback Driven** - Build only what users validate

4. Collect LOIs based on vision

### If Funding Delayed
1. Focus on revenue generation
2. Offer lifetime deals for cash
3. Consider revenue-based financing

## Conclusion

This roadmap represents a realistic path for a solo developer with AI assistance to build a fundable B2G SaaS platform. The key is maintaining laser focus on demo-quality features first, then expanding based on real customer feedback.

The timeline accounts for the reality that one person, even with AI assistance, can only build so much. However, by leveraging modern tools, managed services, and pre-built components, it's possible to achieve what previously required a team of 3-4 developers.

Success depends on:
1. **Ruthless prioritization** - Build only what's needed for the next milestone
2. **Customer feedback loops** - Ship early and iterate based on real usage
3. **Technical pragmatism** - Buy vs build, use managed services, avoid complexity
4. **AI leverage** - Use Claude Code to multiply productivity
5. **Revenue focus** - Get paying customers ASAP to validate and extend runway

By June 2026, the platform will be ready for team expansion with a solid technical foundation, proven product-market fit, and clear scaling path.
