### **3. Service Boundary Clarity**

#### **Clear Domain Separation:**
```yaml
# Each agent knows exactly what they can/cannot modify
ag-identity:
  description: "FastAPI authentication microservice specialist for JWT tokens, MFA, user management, RBAC, published API design, OpenAPI specification, and service unit testing"
  boundaries:
    can_modify: ["services/identity-service/**"]
    cannot_modify: ["other microservices", "API Gateway config", "shared infrastructure"]
```

### **Optimization Process**

#### **Step 1: Analyze Current Architecture**
```bash
# Document your microservices
services_count=4
api_gateway="Kong"
database_strategy="PostgreSQL multi-database"
frontend_technology="React TypeScript"
backend_technology="Django + FastAPI microservices"
```

#### **Step 2: Define Agent Domains**
```yaml
# Map each agent to specific responsibilities
agent_domains:
  coordinator: "API Gateway + cross-service orchestration"
  infrastructure: "Docker + Kubernetes + deployment"
  identity: "Authentication microservice"
  communication: "Notifications microservice"
  content: "Document management microservice" 
  workflow: "Process automation microservice"
  backend: "Core Django business logic"
  frontend: "React UI + API integration"
```

#### **Step 3: Optimize Descriptions**
```yaml
# Use template pattern for consistency
description_template: "[Technology] [domain] specialist for [specific functionality], [integration context], and [quality aspects]"

# Example:
description: "FastAPI authentication microservice specialist for JWT tokens and MFA, API contracts for frontend and inter-service communication, and service unit testing"
```

#### **Step 4: Test Routing Accuracy**
```bash
# Create test scenarios for each agent
test_scenarios:
  - "Configure Kong routing for microservices" → ag-coordinator (expected)
  - "Implement JWT authentication endpoints" → ag-identity (expected) 
  - "Build React components for dashboard" → ag-frontend (expected)
  - "Set up Docker containers for services" → ag-infrastructure (expected)
```

#### **Step 5: Measure and Iterate**
```yaml
# Track routing success rates
metrics:
  routing_accuracy: >90%
  task_completion_rate: >95%
  iteration_reduction: >40%
  context_efficiency: >80%
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Optimization Patterns**

### **Multi-Service Coordination Patterns**

#### **Hub-and-Spoke Pattern** (Recommended)
```yaml
# Central coordinator manages all cross-service interactions
ag-coordinator:
  role: "Central hub for cross-service coordination"
  manages: ["API Gateway", "service discovery", "integration testing"]
  
# Spoke agents focus on individual services
ag-[service]:
  role: "Service specialist"
  reports_to: "ag-coordinator for integration needs"
  manages: ["service implementation", "unit testing", "API design"]
```

#### **Layered Coordination Pattern**
```yaml
# Layer 1: Infrastructure (Docker/K8s)
ag-infrastructure: "Container orchestration and deployment"

# Layer 2: Coordination (API Gateway/Service Mesh)  
ag-coordinator: "Service discovery and API routing"

# Layer 3: Services (Individual microservices)
ag-[service]: "Service-specific implementation"

# Layer 4: Quality (Testing/Security)
ag-reviewer, ag-security: "Cross-cutting quality concerns"
```

### **Scaling Optimization**

#### **Template for New Microservices**
```yaml
# Reusable template for adding new microservices
ag-new-service:
  name: "New Service Agent"
  icon: "🔧"  # Choose appropriate icon
  description: "FastAPI new-service microservice specialist for [specific functionality], published API design, OpenAPI specification, and service unit testing"
  working_dir: "services/new-service"
  responsibilities:
    - "FastAPI endpoints for [specific functionality] implementation"
    - "[Database] integration with PostgreSQL"
    - "Published API contract design and OpenAPI specification for /new-service/* endpoints"
    - "Service unit testing with pytest and [functionality] validation"
    - "API endpoint documentation for frontend/inter-service consumption"
    - "Service-level error handling and response standardization"
  commands:
    - "python main.py"
    - "pytest tests/"
  integration:
    coordinator: "ag-coordinator manages API Gateway routing"
    infrastructure: "ag-infrastructure manages containerization"
    quality: "ag-reviewer validates code quality"
```
