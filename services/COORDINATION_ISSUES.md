# Services Coordination Issue Tracking

## üéØ **Purpose**
This file tracks cross-service coordination issues that require Services Coordinator Agent attention. Service agents should report issues here when they encounter problems that affect multiple services or violate coordination standards.

## üìã **Current Open Issues**

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Issue #004: Critical API Gateway and Service Orchestration
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Reporter**: Services Coordinator Agent  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Description**: Multiple critical coordination failures preventing proper service communication and deployment  
**Service(s) Affected**: ALL SERVICES + API Gateway  

**Issues Found**:
1. **Kong API Gateway Port Misalignments**:
   - Communication service: Kong pointed to port 8002, should be 8003
   - Content service: Kong pointed to port 8003, should be 8002  
   - Workflow service: Kong pointed to port 8005, should be 8004
   - Upstream targets also had wrong port mappings

2. **Missing Centralized Orchestration**:
   - No unified Docker Compose file for all services
   - No proper dependency management between services
   - No health check coordination
   - No startup/shutdown scripts for development

3. **Kong Admin Port Conflict**:
   - Kong admin API conflicted with identity service on port 8001

**Resolution Actions**:
‚úÖ **Kong Configuration Fixed**:
- Updated `/services/api-gateway/kong.yml` with correct service ports
- Fixed all upstream target port mappings
- Resolved Kong admin port conflict (moved to 8445)

‚úÖ **Centralized Orchestration Created**:
- Created `/services/docker-compose.yml` with full service stack
- Added proper health checks for all databases and services  
- Implemented dependency-aware service startup ordering
- Added Kong API Gateway integration

‚úÖ **Coordination Scripts Created**:
- `start-all-services.sh` - Coordinated startup with dependency ordering
- `stop-all-services.sh` - Graceful shutdown with cleanup options
- `health-check-all.sh` - Comprehensive health monitoring

‚úÖ **Documentation Updated**:
- Updated services README with centralized coordination instructions
- Added API Gateway routing documentation
- Added service coordination features documentation

**Final Architecture**:
```
Frontend ‚Üí Kong API Gateway (8000) ‚Üí Services
                                 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identity Service (8001)
                                 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Content Service (8002)  
                                 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Communication Service (8003)
                                 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Workflow Service (8004)
```

**Testing Status**: Docker Compose configuration validated successfully  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - All services now properly coordinated through centralized orchestration

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Issue #001: Requirements Management Pattern
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Reporter**: Services Coordinator (detected during identity-service requirements update)  
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Identity service agent initially duplicated shared requirements instead of using `-r ../requirements.shared.txt` pattern  
**Impact**: Breaks centralized dependency management, causes version drift  
**Resolution**: Identity service corrected to use proper shared requirements pattern  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Issue #002: Database Driver Conflicts
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Reporter**: Identity Service Agent (via REQUIREMENTS_UPGRADE_REPORT.md)  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: Shared requirements included conflicting database drivers (asyncpg + psycopg2-binary), causing compilation failures  
**Impact**: Blocks all service upgrades, identity service cannot install dependencies  
**Service(s) Affected**: identity-service, potentially all future services  
**Error Details**:
```
- psycopg2-binary fails with "pg_config executable not found"
- grpcio compilation failures on some systems
- Async/sync PostgreSQL driver conflicts
```
**Resolution**: 
- Removed database drivers from shared requirements
- Made database drivers service-specific (asyncpg for identity, psycopg2-binary for others)  
- Updated documentation with clear driver selection patterns
- Identity service now includes asyncpg==0.29.0 in service-specific dependencies
**Files Updated**:
- `requirements.shared.txt` - Removed conflicting database drivers
- `identity-service/requirements.txt` - Added asyncpg==0.29.0
- `docs/SERVICE_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md` - Added database driver patterns
- `README.md` - Updated requirements management documentation  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Issue #003: Identity Service Requirements Upgrade
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Reporter**: Identity Service Agent (via REQUIREMENTS_UPGRADE_REPORT.md)  
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Identity service successfully upgraded to shared requirements with latest dependencies  
**Service(s) Affected**: identity-service  
**Upgrade Results**:

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Issue #007: Communication Responsibilities Split Between Services
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Reporter**: Services Coordinator (architecture analysis)  
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: Conflicting responsibilities for communication features between Identity Service and Communication Service  
**Service(s) Affected**: identity-service, communication-service  

**üîç Architecture Analysis Completed:**

**Identity Service Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Complete `email_service.py` - handles verification emails, password reset emails
- ‚úÖ Complete `mfa_service.py` - handles email MFA, SMS MFA, TOTP codes  
- ‚úÖ Production-ready email verification flows and SMTP integration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive email templates for authentication flows

**üéØ Final Architecture Decision: OPTION A**
**‚úÖ Identity Service Self-Contained Approach**
- **Identity Service**: Handles ALL authentication-related communications
  - Email verification, password reset emails
  - MFA codes (email, SMS), authentication notifications
  - User onboarding and account security emails
  - Authentication flow templates and delivery
- **Communication Service**: Handles ONLY business notifications
  - Appointment reminders, billing notifications
  - Marketing emails, system announcements
  - Medical reports, patient communications
  - General business workflow notifications

**üèóÔ∏è Service Boundaries Established:**
```python
# IDENTITY SERVICE - Authentication Communications
- Email verification codes
- Password reset flows  
- MFA challenge delivery (email/SMS)
- Account security notifications
- User onboarding emails

# COMMUNICATION SERVICE - Business Communications  
- Appointment notifications
- Billing and payment reminders
- Medical report delivery
- Marketing campaigns
- System maintenance notices
```

**üìã Configuration Sharing Pattern:**
```bash
# Shared via .env.shared for service discovery
IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL=http://identity-service:8001
COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://communication-service:8003

# Service-specific secrets remain isolated
# identity-service/.env - SMTP_PASSWORD for auth emails
# communication-service/.env - SENDGRID_API_KEY for business emails
```

**‚úÖ Benefits of Option A:**
- Clear service boundaries and single responsibility principle
- No duplication of authentication infrastructure 
- Identity service remains self-contained and production-ready
- Communication service focuses purely on business requirements
- Simpler service integration and reduced complexity

**üìö Updated Documentation:**
- Communication Service Agent scope updated to business notifications only
- Service integration patterns documented with clear examples
- Configuration sharing guidelines established for cross-service coordination

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Option A implemented with clear service boundaries

## üõ†Ô∏è **Common Issues and Quick Fixes**

### **Requirements Management**
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG: Duplicating shared dependencies
fastapi==0.116.1
pydantic==2.11.7
# ... (duplicating everything)

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Using shared requirements
-r ../requirements.shared.txt
# Only service-specific dependencies below
aiosmtplib==3.0.1
```

### **Authentication Integration**
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Hardcoded endpoints
identity_url = "http://localhost:8001"

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Environment-based configuration
IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL = os.getenv("IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL", "http://identity-service:8001")
```

### **Database Configuration**
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Service-specific database naming
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myservice"

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Following naming convention
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://content_user:content_pass@content-db:5432/content_service"
```
